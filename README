Data::Tabulate

Data::Tabulate simplifies table generation.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Data::Tabulate aims to simplify the generation of tables. Often you don't have
tables like in databases (with header and several rows of data), but tables with
content only (like image galleries or listings displayed as tables).

You can use other modules (e.g. HTML::Table) to produce specific output.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use Data::Tabulate;
    use Data::Dumper;
    
    my @array = qw(1..12);
    
    my $foo   = Data::Tabulate->new();
    my @table = $foo->tabulate(@array);

returns

    (
        [  1,  2,  3 ],
        [  4,  5,  6 ],
        [  7,  8,  9 ],
        [ 10, 11, 12 ]
    )
